def compute_sample_weight(y, n_classes=2, class_weight=None, eps=1e-8):
    """Estimate sample weights by class for unbalanced datasets.
    Similar to sklearn.utils.class_weight.compute_sample_weight.

    Default behavior to balance classes but class_weight can be passed
    as argument.

    The weights will be normalized so their sum is equals to the number of
    samples. This normalization isn't present in sklearn's version.

    Args:
        y: 1D tensor
            Array of original class labels per sample.
        n_classes: int
            Number of unique classes
        class_weight: 1D FloatTensor
            Class weights where its idx correspond to class value
        eps: float
            Value for numerical stability

    Returns:
        weights: 1D FloatTensor
           Sample weights as applied to the original y.

    Examples:
    >>> y = torch.FloatTensor([1, 0, 0, 0])
